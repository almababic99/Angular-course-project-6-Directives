  <!-- The ngIf directive in Angular is used for conditional rendering of elements. It adds or removes an element from the DOM based on a condition, which is evaluated at runtime. 
   If the condition evaluates to true, the element is included in the DOM; if the condition evaluates to false, the element is removed from the DOM. -->
  <!-- *ngIf="isAdmin()": The * indicates that ngIf is a structural directive, meaning it modifies the structure of the DOM. The expression inside ngIf (in this case, isAdmin()) is evaluated. 
    If the expression evaluates to true, the <p> element and its contents will be rendered in the DOM. If the expression evaluates to false, the <p> element will be removed from the DOM entirely. -->

  <!-- The *appAuth directive checks the user's permission (passed as the value in the directive, such as 'admin', 'user', or 'guest') against the active permission. Based on this, it either shows or hides the <p> tags with the specific content. -->
  <!-- If the user's permission does not match, the element is removed from the DOM, effectively hiding it. -->
