  <!-- The ngIf directive in Angular is used for conditional rendering of elements. It adds or removes an element from the DOM based on a condition, which is evaluated at runtime. 
   If the condition evaluates to true, the element is included in the DOM; if the condition evaluates to false, the element is removed from the DOM. -->
  <!-- *ngIf="isAdmin()": The * indicates that ngIf is a structural directive, meaning it modifies the structure of the DOM. The expression inside ngIf (in this case, isAdmin()) is evaluated. 
    If the expression evaluates to true, the <p> element and its contents will be rendered in the DOM. If the expression evaluates to false, the <p> element will be removed from the DOM entirely. -->
